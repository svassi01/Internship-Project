Sample Size Calculation tool
R Shiny App created to calculate sample size for a diagnostic tool's accuracy based on user's specification.
Consists of four tabs corresponding to four different scenarios:
- Tab 1:Hypothesis Testing:
Provides figures with rejection regions and confidence intervals for specified target, expectation of agreement and people tested. 

- Tab 2: Power Calculation:
Computes either the exact or approximate power of a test based on a prespecified number of people tested

- Tab 3: Sample Size Calculation:
Computes the required sample size to achieve an acceptable level of power based on a target and estimation of agreement

- Tab 4: Final Sample Size:
Subsequent phase of Tab 3. Based on the selected measure and the prevalence in the population of interest, the final sample size is computed
